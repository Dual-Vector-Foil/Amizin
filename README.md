# Amizin

Here we share some models to demonstrate [Lincubator](https://github.com/UlyssesWu/D2Evil#lincubator).

**Lincubator** is a moc3 decompiler, which takes moc3 file as input and convert it to cmo3 project file. Lincubator is not open-source for now.

All samples we used are public download-able or preview-able†. We do not provide the original moc3 file unless the license allowed.

Therefore, we are NOT *re-distributing* (転載/再配布) any content. If you like this models, you still have to buy or ask for them.

† This means all samples are gathered legally.

## Demos

See [Release](https://github.com/Dual-Vector-Foil/Amizin/releases) page.

The demos are generated with preview (very low) texture quality.

You're only allowed to preview them. You can NOT use them for any other purpose without permission. You can NOT re-distribute or sell them.

If you like this models, please consider buy them.
